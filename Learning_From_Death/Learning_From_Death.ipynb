    "- Finds patients who have died during a particular admission.\n",
    "- Obtains key risk factors for death and key information documenting the admission.\n",
    "- Risk stratifies patient mortality by validated risk scoring systems (CCI and HFRS) using comorbidipy (see documentation).\n",
    "- Deposit the results into a flat file on the network for use by clinical teams for the purposes of morbidity and mortality estimation to help improve the quality of discussion and visibility for those involved in the direct clinical care of the patients."

These database URLS follow a particular protocol and generally include the username, password, hostname and database name, and some other optional keyword arguments for additional configuration (in our example we have included a service_name configuration option to connect to the Oracle database)\n",
