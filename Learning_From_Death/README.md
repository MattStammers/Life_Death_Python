# Learning From Death

### Instructions

Please make sure you have followed the readme before beginning. All the code is commented.

### Clients

We have used the oracle instantclient version 11.2 for this project to keep things simple. This is a slightly older lightweight thin-client which can connect to most oracle databases. It is pretty easy to setup and install and can be obtained from the oracle website https://www.oracle.com/downloads/, however it will obviously not work if you are querying a non-oracle database in which case you will need to select and install the correct client.

### Testing

If you want to test this out without connecting directly to a local database we will include some dummy data in flat files that you can load in directly. If you want to create a virtual test database on your local machine we recommend PostgresSQL.

### Usage

The template is there to act a guide and the SQL query wouldn't help you anyway because our PAS is unusual so we have not included the exact SQL code. You will need to speak to your local IT team to work out a SQL query that will fit your local needs - once you have the rest of the template working however this is the easy part.
