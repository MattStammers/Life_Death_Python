# Protecting Life

### Instructions

For this repo we have taken a slightly different approach and built the data extractor into a .py module which is able to extract the data automatically. If you are new to python we recommend starting with 'learning from death' before moving onto this repository. 

### Clients

We have used the oracle instantclient version 11.2 for this project to keep things simple. This is a slightly older lightweight thin-client which can connect to most oracle databases. It is pretty easy to setup and install and can be obtained from the oracle website https://www.oracle.com/downloads/, however it will obviously not work if you are querying a non-oracle database in which case you will need to select and install the correct client.

### Usage

The template is there to act a guide and the SQL query wouldn't help you anyway because our PAS is unusual so we have not included the exact SQL code. You will need to speak to your local IT team to work out a SQL query that will fit your local needs - once you have the rest of the template working however this is the easy part.
