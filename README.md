The purpose of this simple repository is to demonstrate the use of code to solve frontline clinical problems in a way that almost any frontline NHS worker could achieve with a little bit of knowledge. 

It should be viewed as an example only in the hope that it will inspire others to try to solve similar problems in their own hospitals. 

There are two frontline clincial problems dealt with:

1) Learning from Death: Mortality and morbidity 10-year survival score calcluation using vvcb's excellent comorbidipy: https://github.com/vvcb/comorbidipy
2) Protecting Life: Saving life by improving the hospitals GI bleed care model and analysing the outcome with python.
